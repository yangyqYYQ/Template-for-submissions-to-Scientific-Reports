\section*{Background}

In the first week of starting this project, I think it necessary for understanding what Crispr/Cas9-based genetic screening is, and what should be considered in analyzing the screening data.  The idea of Crispr/Cas9-based genetic screening was to use a pool of sgRNA-expressing lentivirus to generate a library of knockout cells that could be screened under both positive and negative selection. \cite{wang2014genetic} In addition to transfection, Pooled screening can avoid experimental errors caused by high expression of sgRNA.

\section*{Results}

Up to three levels of \textbf{subheading} are permitted. Subheadings should not be numbered.

\subsection*{Subsection}

Example text under a subsection. Bulleted lists may be used where appropriate, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Third-level section}
 
Topical subheadings are allowed.

\section*{Discussion}

The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.

\section*{Methods}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work.

\bibliography{sample}

\noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, e.g.  \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}.

For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g. \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample bibliography file.

\section*{Acknowledgements (not compulsory)}

Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

\section*{Author contributions statement}

Must include all authors, identified by initials, for example:
A.A. conceived the experiment(s),  A.A. and B.A. conducted the experiment(s), C.A. and D.A. analysed the results.  All authors reviewed the manuscript. 

\section*{Additional information}
